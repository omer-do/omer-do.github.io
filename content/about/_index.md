I'm Omer Dolev, a production engineer who likes to understand how things work, even outside the realm of tech.

When I'm not debugging production, I'm into food, baking, coffee, sports and health, languages, economics, math, physics, and whatever else catches my attention.

This blog is where I write about all of it.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/omerdlv), [GitHub](https://github.com/omer-do), and [X](https://x.com/omer_dolev).
