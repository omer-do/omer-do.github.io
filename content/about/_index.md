I'm Omer Dolev, a production engineer who likes to understand how things work — from the infrastructure layer all the way down.

Outside of tech, I'm into food, baking, coffee, sports and health, languages, economics, math, physics, and whatever else catches my attention.

This blog is where I write about all of it.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/omerdlv) and [GitHub](https://github.com/omer-do).
