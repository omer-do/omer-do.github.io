&lt;p&gt;The VPC is the foundation of your infrastructure in the cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s a general idea (used by providers) of a way you (the customer) can use the provider&amp;rsquo;s resources. The following is going to be based on AWS (since that&amp;rsquo;s what I have experience in).
For that purpose you create a kind of an overlay network in their infrastructure and this network will contain all the resources and services you utilize. This network, it&amp;rsquo;s components and configurations comprise your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-all-that-cloud-buzz&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s All That Cloud Buzz?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons so many new start-ups can try to make our life easier is &amp;ldquo;THE CLOUD&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an apartment, you have your living room, bedroom, bath room, kitchen and accessories.
Suddenly, you get a deal from your work place, a 3 months vacation (a place eveyone would like to work at) to the caribbeans. During these 3 months, even if you are not effectively using your apartment, you still have to pay rent and additional bills and fees.&lt;br&gt;
In that case, what many would do is subletting their apartment, which means that they can make some money during their vacation and cover the expenses for their apartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
