I know people that have been working with it for years, and still dont have a good grasp on what’s going on in certain parts. In the next few posts (a Kubernets series) I will go over the things I know about Kubernetes. We will delve into different concepts as we continue on.\nNOTE: From now on I will mostly write “K8s” instead of “Kubernetes”.\nWhat is Kubernetes? Fun Fact: The name Kubernetes is from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot (see K8s docs).\nTo find an answer to that question you can visit K8s docs, but if you are already here then, K8s is summed up most of the times as a container orchestrator. When you look at it pragmatically it’s what most of the job of K8s is, running containers. But in reality it’s much much more than that.\nThere are many different factors embedded in the notion of running containers, and K8s let’s you control that if you like. Making things flexible when needed but it also enables automation.\nWe can start understanding things if we look at the state things were before it container orchestration solutions were common. We are actually talking about how things were deployed and running over time.\nNOTE: When writing “workload”, I mean anything that does processing, anything that runs code or runs some sort of logic, whether it is handling requests, doing some async processing etc.\nTraditional Deployments Running workloads on physical servers. There are lots of problems with this approach which will be described later (of course it’s easy to discern retro), but for now let’s continue.\nVirtualized Deployments Virtualization is a way to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on one physical server. This is actually running multiple Operating systems (Linux, Windows, Embedded or whatever) concurrently on the same physical machine that are independent of one another. This was the time when deploying virtual machines runnning the different applications and services was common.\nContainerized Deployments Deployment of workloads as containers. We will have a post about what are containers exactly. For now let’s think about them as very lightweight VMs. This is the present, in which deployment of application on containers is very common.\nSo now, in a time where running application is mainly done by containers, there is something very important to keep in mind, and it’s the availability of your application. When an application expriences a fault or a panic in the Traditional Deployments era, the relevant team would be alerted and would go straight to the server to fix, and later will try to understand what happened (in this case most of fixes are restarts). The same thing holds for VMs (Virtualized Deployments), where you relevant team would check the problem, fix, and try to understand the root cause.\nBut, in the containers era something changed. A new outlook surfaced, in which workloads are volatile. It became very easy to just start a new container running the required workload instead of trying to fix the problem while there is downtime or degraded availability (downtime - when the service is unavailable).\nThis is where K8s comes in, it provides you with a framework and tools to run distributed systems resiliently. Distributed systems are systems or a group of workloads that run on a number of machines (can range from a few to dozens and hundreds or more), which in it’s simplest form can technically be achieved quite easily (it gets complicated when new use-cases arise, but we’ll get into that).\nK8s gives you:\nService discovery and load balancing which we will get into when we talk about networking in K8s.\nStorage orchestration\nAutomated rollouts and rollbacks and lots of deployment practices\nSelf healing ensuring availability\nSecret and configuration management\nThere are lots of things to think about when running distributed systems, K8s is based on loads of experience Google has in this field. The thing I like most is that while working with K8s there were many light bulbs that went on in my head, and writing this blog also helps me learn more about it.\n","wordCount":"683","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://omer-do.github.io/img/hello-kubernetes-1.png","datePublished":"2020-12-11T10:10:00+08:00","dateModified":"2020-12-11T10:10:00+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Omer Dolev"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://omer-do.github.io/posts/2020-12-11-hello-kubernetes/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"od-stack","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://omer-do.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://omer-do.github.io/ accesskey=h title="od-stack (Alt + H)">od-stack</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
