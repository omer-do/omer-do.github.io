      <title>AWS Virtual Private Cloud</title>

&lt;p&gt;The VPC is the foundation of your infrastructure in the cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s a general idea (used by providers) of a way you (the customer) can use the provider&amp;rsquo;s resources. The following is going to be based on AWS (since that&amp;rsquo;s what I have experience in).
For that purpose you create a kind of an overlay network in their infrastructure and this network will contain all the resources and services you utilize. This network, it&amp;rsquo;s components and configurations comprise your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-all-that-cloud-buzz&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s All That Cloud Buzz?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons so many new start-ups can try to make our life easier is &amp;ldquo;THE CLOUD&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an apartment, you have your living room, bedroom, bath room, kitchen and accessories.
Suddenly, you get a deal from your work place, a 3 months vacation (a place eveyone would like to work at) to the caribbeans. During these 3 months, even if you are not effectively using your apartment, you still have to pay rent and additional bills and fees.&lt;br&gt;
In that case, what many would do is subletting their apartment, which means that they can make some money during their vacation and cover the expenses for their apartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes - How It Fits Together (K8s series - 6)</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-to-the-roots&#34;&gt;Going to the Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much much more to talk about the control plane, but that&amp;rsquo;s for more specific posts. Eventually, what we want to do in K8s is actually running workloads in the form of Pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a Pod? It&amp;rsquo;s components? You can read about it from a high-level perspective in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/&#34;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Rewinding back to the containers post, we remember that Linux containers are not really &amp;ldquo;containers&amp;rdquo; they are normal processes, executed using 2 features of the Linux Kernel: Namespaces and Control Groups (cgroups).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In K8s, as in many other products the architecture is a manager/master and worker nodes architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to cover everything in just one post, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the control plane.&lt;br&gt;
If you needed to manage something like this, orchestrating containers, in a very large scale (hundreds to thousands of containers), how would you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a very big question. But, let&amp;rsquo;s break it down to simpler objectives or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Low and High Level Container Runtimes (K8s series - 4)</title>
      <link>https://omer-do.github.io/posts/2020-12-14-low-and-high-level-runtimes/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a short dive into the world of container runtimes, talking about low-level and high-level runtimes (which from now will be referred to
as low-level runtimes and high-level runtimes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous post, conatiners (in Linux of course) are implemented by Linux namespaces and cgroups. Namespaces help you virtualize
the environment while cgroups helps you limit resources consumed by a process. The main responsibility of the low-level runtimes is the creation and
configuration of such namespaces and cgroups for containers, and then execution inside those namespaces and cgroups (this is the core functionality
of the low-level runtimes, which usually implement more features).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Container Runtimes (K8s series - 3)</title>
      <link>https://omer-do.github.io/posts/2020-12-11-container-runtimes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember all the things we now know about containers?
So every time we want a container we need to create different namespaces and then spawn the process, and when the process exits we need remove them all
and do some cleanup? NO&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what container runtimes are for. As you will see in a moment there are many runtimes, and they are usually called low-level or high-level runtimes.
One of the most famous container runtimes is Docker. But since Docker&amp;rsquo;s release many changes took place in this field on container runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Containers (K8s series - 2)</title>

      <guid>https://omer-do.github.io/posts/2020-12-11-containers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Header Image&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://omer-do.github.io/img/containers-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers are awesome. At first they sound quite simple, but they enable many things that weren&amp;rsquo;t possible before. Here I will explain what are containers in a bit of a deep-dive so you can truly understand what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers are applications that are abstraced from the environment in which they run. This is the high-level explanation, which is of course correct but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit vague and general. It is noteworthy that this abstraction is very useful for allowing applications to be deployed easily and consistently (that is regardless what machine the container runs on). What&amp;rsquo;s more interesting is how containers are actually implemented (at least in Linux) and just how different they are from VMs.
Understanding how they are implemented in Linux will give you an idea about what they are and will help you understand the whole thing better as we move on to talk about K8s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello Kubernetes (K8s series - 1)</title>
      <link>https://omer-do.github.io/posts/2020-12-11-hello-kubernetes/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a very big subject. I know people that have been working with it for years, and still dont have a good grasp on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in certain parts.
In the next few posts (a Kubernets series) I will go over the things I know about Kubernetes. We will delve into different concepts as we continue on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; From now on I will mostly write &amp;ldquo;K8s&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
